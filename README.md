# Family Map Client

This project is part of the BYU CS240 course, designed to build an Android app that provides users with a geographical view of their family history using data from a Family Map server. The app leverages Google Maps for visualizing family events and relationships, connecting users to their historical roots through an intuitive and interactive interface.

## Project Goals
The Family Map Client project covers key concepts in:
- Object-Oriented Design
- User Interface Programming
- Native Android Development
- Web API integration
- Unit Testing

## Application Overview
The Family Map Client includes six main views to help users explore family events:
- **Main Activity**: Initial view, displays login and top-level map
- **Login Fragment**: Allows user login and registration
- **Event Activity**: Shows maps with detailed event markers
- **Person Activity**: Displays a person’s details and relationships
- **Settings Activity**: Lets users manage app settings
- **Filter Activity**: Controls which events are shown on the map
- **Search Activity**: Provides a search interface for people and events

## Key Features
### Main Activity
- Contains a **Login Fragment** for initial login and registration.
- Displays a **Map Fragment** showing family events upon successful login.

### Map Fragment
- An interactive map showing events from a user’s family history.
- Filters events based on settings in **Settings** and **Filter** activities.
- Displays event details, with clickable markers representing different event types.

### Person Activity
- Shows person’s details and lists their relationships and life events.
- Click on relationships or events to view further details in **Event** and **Person** activities.

### Event Activity
- Displays detailed information for a selected event on the map.
- Centered on the selected event, with map interaction and event relationship lines.

### Settings Activity
- Options for logout, data re-sync, map type selection, and enabling/disabling relationship lines.

### Filter Activity
- Allows users to control event visibility by event type, gender, and family side.

### Search Activity
- Provides search capabilities for people and events.
- Search results include both people and events, navigable to **Person** or **Event** activities.

## Technical Requirements

### Dependencies
- **Family Map Server**: Uses data generated by the server.
- **Google Maps for Android**: For displaying interactive maps.
- **Android Iconify**: For drawing gender and event icons.

### Testing
- **JUnit Tests**: To verify server connections and model functionality.
  - Tests for server proxy operations: login, registration, data retrieval.
  - Model tests for relationship calculations, event filtering, and sorting.
  - Ensure test cases include both success and failure conditions.

## Grading Criteria
- **Functionality**: How well the app works and meets specifications.
- **Test Case Quality**: Coverage and depth of test cases.
- **Source Code Quality**: Effective class/method naming, decomposition, readability, and organization.

## Resources
- **Google Maps Documentation**: [Google Maps for Android API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-api/start)
- **Android Iconify**: [Android Iconify Library](https://github.com/JoanZapata/android-iconify)

## Submission
1. **Code Submission**: Create a `.zip` file of the entire project, name it after your NetID, and upload it to the designated assignment.
2. **Test Results**: Submit a screenshot of successful test case results from Android Studio.
3. **Source Code Review**: Code will be evaluated based on naming, organization, decomposition, and layout.

Ensure you meet all requirements and test thoroughly before submission.
